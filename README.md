# Interactive Morphisms Visualization

This project provides an interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring relationships and morphisms across various domains, with a particular focus on film theory, philosophy, and critical analysis.

## Features

- Interactive cards representing morphisms between entities
- Color-coded relationships for easy categorization
- Real-time filtering of morphisms
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Theory

This visualization tool is based on the concept of morphisms, which represent transformations or relationships between entities in different domains. The project draws inspiration from several theoretical frameworks:

1. Postphenomenology: Exploring how technology mediates human-world relations
2. Metamodernism: Examining the oscillation between modernist and postmodernist approaches in art and culture
3. Film Theory: Analyzing the relationships between different cinematic works, directors, and critical perspectives
4. Relational Ontology: Focusing on the interconnectedness of entities and ideas

By visualizing these relationships, the tool aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the complex networks of influence, inspiration, and critical dialogue in fields such as cinema, philosophy, and cultural theory.

The interactive nature of the visualization encourages users to explore connections between seemingly disparate concepts, potentially revealing new insights or areas for further research.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the filter input to search for specific morphisms or entities
